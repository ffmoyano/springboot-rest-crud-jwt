### Rest API example with CRUD and JWT auth

This app is mainly made for quick reference purposes but could be used as a quickstart with a bit of cleanup.

The following libraries are defined in the pom.xml:  
* **Spring JPA**: for database persistence of entities.
* **Spring Validation**: to check that DTO objects sent to the app are valid.
* **Spring Security**: to protect endpoints and manage authentication and authorization.
* **com.auth0.java.jwt**: to generate JWT tokens
* **org.modelmapper.ModelMapper**: to easily convert between DTOs and JPA entities.
* **org.apache.commons.commons-lang3**: contains convenient utility classes for data manipulation.
* **org.mariadb.jdbc.mariadb-java-client**: the database driver, change the dependency if other database used.

Also, the app uses **BcryptPasswordEncoder** for password encryption and **slf4j** for logging,  
both of them can be changed in the **configuration.BeanConfiguration** class.

The app has its **CORS** headers defined with all the urls allowed by default,  
this can be changed in the **configuration.WebConfiguration** class

The authorization and authentication are managed by Spring Security with UserDetails and two filters,  
**filter.CustomAuthenticationFilter**, which extends **UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter** and  
**filter.CustomAuthorizationFilter**, which extends **OncePerRequestFilter**.  
The **UserDetails.loadUserByUsername** method is implemented in the **service.UserService** class.

`When the server returns an unauthorized code, the client must check if it also returns a refreshtoken.
If it does it must call the server endpoint "refreshToken", to see if a new token can be issued.

For security reasons the **application.properties** is not added to the repository,   
so here are listed the properties used:`


spring.datasource.url=yourdatabaseconnectionstring  
spring.datasource.username=yourusername  
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword  
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=databasedriver  
spring.jpa.show-sql=true  
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update  
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=yourdialect  
variables.jwtSecret=yourjwtsecret
